      The upstream DNS server(s) the cache should use. The defaults are Google DNS. Multiple upstream dns servers are allowed, separated by semi colons (or spaces). Do NOT point this at lancache-dns.
    default: 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
  - name: CACHE_DISK_SIZE
    description: >-
      The amount of disk space the container should use for caching data.  Specified in gigabytes.
    default: 1000g
  - name: CACHE_INDEX_SIZE
    description: >-
      Amount of index memory for the nginx cache manager. We recommend 250m of index memory per 1TB of CACHE_DISK_SIZE 
    default: 500m
  - name: CACHE_MAX_AGE
    description: >-
      The maximum amount of time a file should be held in cache. There is usually no reason to reduce this - the cache will automatically remove the oldest content if it needs the space.
    default: 3560d

  - name: NGINX_LOG_FORMAT
    description: >-
      The log format NGINX emits. Can be set to <code>cachelog-json</code> to force NGINX to emit JSON logs. This helps parsing logs without complicated Grok or Regex patterns.

  - name: FORCE_PERMS_CHECK
    description: >-
      Force a full permissions check on startup.  When the container starts up normally, it checks a few key locations to ensure that they are owned by the correct user.  This option will force the container to do a full check of all cache directories and files.  THIS WILL BE VERY SLOW, AND MAY POSSIBLY TAKE HOURS.
